### Command History Check
The following commands were executed in this task:
1. sudo nixos-rebuild list-generations (read-only, no activation)
2. readlink -f /run/current-system (read-only, no activation)
3. sudo cp -a /etc/nixos /etc/nixos.pre-unify.20260217-1732 (backup only, no activation)

### Proof
- No `nixos-rebuild switch` command appears in task execution log
- No `nixos-rebuild boot` command appears in task execution log
- No `nixos-rebuild test` command appears in task execution log
- No `nixos-rebuild dry-activate` command appears in task execution log
- All commands executed were read-only or backup operations

### Rollback Path (if needed)
To restore to pre-unification state:
  sudo cp -a /etc/nixos.pre-unify.20260217-1732 /etc/nixos
  sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /etc/nixos#desktop

### Current Generation (Baseline)

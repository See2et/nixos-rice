Task 14: Stale Import Scan Results
===================================
Date: 2026-02-17

1. STALE IMPORTS FOUND AND FIXED:

   a) hosts/desktop/default.nix imported ../../home.nix (legacy monolith)
      - home.nix provides: catppuccin, stateVersion=25.05, home-manager.enable, session vars
      - session vars already in home/common/session.nix (duplicate)
      - catppuccin moved to home/common/default.nix (shared across all platforms)
      - stateVersion set to 25.11 directly in desktop host HM block
      - programs.home-manager.enable set directly in desktop host HM block
      - REMOVED: ../../home.nix import from desktop HM imports

   b) configuration.nix imported ./hardware-configuration.nix
      - hosts/desktop/default.nix ALSO imports ../../hardware-configuration.nix
      - Duplicate import (NixOS deduplicates, but it's messy)
      - REMOVED: ./hardware-configuration.nix from configuration.nix imports
      - Host file now owns hardware wiring exclusively

2. SCAN: No remaining stale imports in host/module/home trees

   grep -r 'home\.nix' hosts/ modules/ home/ => NO MATCHES
   grep -r '\./hardware-configuration' hosts/ => ONLY hosts/desktop (correct)
   grep -r 'home\.nix' hosts/desktop/ => NO MATCHES (cleaned)

3. ALL CONFIGS EVALUATE CLEANLY:
   - nix eval .#nixosConfigurations.desktop => OK (drv path resolved)
   - nix eval .#nixosConfigurations.wsl => OK (drv path resolved)
   - nix eval .#homeConfigurations.darwin => OK (username resolved)

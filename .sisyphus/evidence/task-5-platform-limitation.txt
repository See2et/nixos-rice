# Task 5 - Darwin HM Build Platform Limitation

## Environment
- Current system: x86_64-linux (NixOS desktop)
- Target system: aarch64-darwin (macOS)

## Verification Results

### ✓ Darwin HM Eval Succeeds
Command: nix eval .#homeConfigurations.darwin.activationPackage.drvPath
Result: "/nix/store/aah9ixf37flyv4lz6x5a4vdb1zddg9pp-home-manager-generation.drv"
Status: SUCCESS

The evaluation succeeds, proving the import graph is correctly wired and the scaffold modules are properly structured.

### ✗ Darwin HM Build Cannot Execute (Expected)
Reason: aarch64-darwin derivations cannot be built on x86_64-linux without cross-compilation setup.
This is a platform limitation, not a configuration error. The derivation is correctly formed (as proven by successful eval).

## Conclusion
Task 5 acceptance criteria are MET:
- ✓ Home tree scaffolding created (home/common, home/linux, home/wsl, home/darwin)
- ✓ Import graph wired in flake.nix
- ✓ Darwin HM eval succeeds (proof of correct wiring)
- ✓ Platform limitation documented (build requires aarch64-darwin system)

Task 9: WSL Leakage Check in home/common (scope-corrected)
============================================================
Date: 2026-02-17

grep -rn '/mnt/c|opencode-wsl-notify|opencode-notifier' home/common/

Results (comments only, no functional leakage):
  home/common/default.nix:3: # CRITICAL: No /mnt/c paths, no WSL notifier, no platform-specific packages
  home/common/session.nix:2: # WSL-specific PATH (/mnt/c/...) belongs in home/wsl

VERDICT: PASS
All matches are documentation comments explaining what NOT to put in common.
No functional WSL-specific code exists in home/common/.

Scope correction note:
  files.nix and xdg.nix removed from home/common/ (they referenced
  out-of-scope dotfile trees). Dotfile migration deferred to later task.

=== Task 8: Desktop No-Leak Verification ===
Date: 2026-02-17T17:55:38+09:00

--- Structural check: desktop host imports ---
Desktop host (hosts/desktop/default.nix) imports:
    ../../modules/nixos/common
    ../../modules/nixos/desktop
    ../../hardware-configuration.nix
    ../../configuration.nix

WSL module path (modules/nixos/wsl) is NOT in desktop imports. PASS.

--- Structural check: WSL host imports ---
WSL host (hosts/wsl/default.nix) imports:
    ../../modules/nixos/common
    ../../modules/nixos/wsl

WSL module path (modules/nixos/wsl) IS in WSL imports. PASS.

--- Note: desktop eval currently fails due to modules/nixos/desktop not yet existing (Task 7 pending) ---
--- This is a pre-existing condition, not caused by Task 8 ---

--- WSL host nix-ld.enable (positive control) ---
true

Conclusion: WSL-only options are structurally isolated to modules/nixos/wsl/
and only imported by hosts/wsl/default.nix. No desktop leakage. PASS.
